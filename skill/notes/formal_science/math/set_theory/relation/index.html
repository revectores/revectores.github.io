<h3 id="basic-concept">Basic Concept</h3>
<h5 id="basic-concepts-about-relation"># Basic Concepts About Relation</h5>
<p>Assume that <span class="math inline">\(X, Y\)</span> are two sets, the subset <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X\times Y\)</span> is defined as the <strong>binary relation</strong> or <strong>relation</strong> from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. If tuple <span class="math inline">\((x, y)\in R\)</span>, we say <span class="math inline">\(x, y\)</span> satisfies relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, denoted as <span class="math inline">\(xRy\)</span>, and we named <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as the <strong>antecedent</strong>, and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> as <strong>seccedent</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Domain</strong> and <strong>Range</strong> of relation are denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\dom(R)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ran(R)\)</span>, which are defined as <span class="math display">\[
\dom(R) = \{x\ |\ (x,y)\in R\} \\
\ran(R) = \{y\ |\ (x,y)\in R\}
\]</span></p>
<h5 id="classification"># Classification</h5>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(X=Y\)</span>, the sebset is called the relation <strong>on</strong> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, this binary relation is called a <strong>homogeneous relation</strong>. The <span class="math inline">\(X\neq Y\)</span> case is called heterogeneous relatively.</p>
<p>There’re several special relations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There’re two trivial subsets of <span class="math inline">\(X\times Y\)</span>, empty set <span class="math inline">\(\varnothing\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\times Y\)</span> itself, which two are called <strong>Empty Relation</strong> and <strong>Total Relation</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Identity Relaiton <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> above <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(I_x = \{(x,x)\ | \ x\in X\}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The relation which got <strong>one any only one</strong> seccedent for any antecedent is called <strong><a href="Function">Function</a></strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h5 id="representation-of-relation"># Representation of Relation</h5>
<p>Since the relation is no more than a set, so any methods to represent a set can be used to represent a binary relation. Besides, there’re <strong>Relation Map</strong> and <strong>Relation Matrix</strong> to help us represent binary relation.</p>
<h3 id="calculation-of-relation">Calculation of Relation</h3>
<h5 id="basic-calculation"># Basic Calculation</h5>
<p>Again, since relation is no more than a set, any calculations between sets work on relation as well, notes that the universal set of complementary calculation is <span class="math inline">\(X\times Y\)</span>. Besides, there’re two more calculation for relations: <strong>Reverse</strong> and <strong>Compose</strong>.</p>
<p>Reverse of relation change the position of antecedent and seccedent: <span class="math display">\[
R^{-1} = \{(y, x) \ | \ (x,y)\in R \}
\]</span> Composition of relation compose two relation into one: <span class="math display">\[
R\circ S = \{(x,z)\ |  \ (x,y)\in R,\ (y,z)\in S \}
\]</span> It’s trival that the composition with identity relation don’t change the original relation, this can be proved by the conditions of set equivlance (notice the symbol and domain):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R: X\rightarrow Y\)</span>, Prove that <span class="math inline">\(I_X\circ R = R\circ I_Y = R\)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="function">Function</h3>
<h5 id="basic-concepts"># Basic Concepts</h5>
<p>As mentioned before, function is a relation which got <strong>one any only one</strong> seccedent for any antecedent.</p>
<h5 id="composition-and-reverse-of-function"># Composition and Reverse of Function</h5>
<p>The reverse of function is a relation but not may not be a function, unless it’s a <strong>bijective</strong>.</p>
<p>The compostion of function is still a function, and the composition keeps the correspondent property of function, which means if two functions <span class="math inline">\(F,G\)</span> are (sur/in/bi)jective, the composition of them <span class="math inline">\(F\circ G\)</span> is also (sur/in/bi)jective.</p>
<p>This is another test about this helper who is not the succdent.</p>

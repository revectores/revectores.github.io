<h1 id="naive-bayes-algorithm">Naive Bayes Algorithm</h1>
<p>Just simply apply the Bayes’ rule, the likelihood and prior probability are given by training set, choose the one prediction with maxmium inverse probability. Formally, <span class="math display">\[
\hat y = \arg\max_{y\in \mathcal Y} P(y|X)
\]</span> where the inverse probability is computed as <span class="math display">\[
P(y|X) = \cfrac{P(Xy)}{P(X)} = \cfrac{P(y)P(X|y)}{\displaystyle\sum_{y\in \mathcal Y}P(y)P(X|y)}
\]</span> where terms <span class="math inline">\(P(y), P(X|y)\)</span> are computed(learned) from training test.</p>
<p>Through its a quite simple applying the Bayes’ rule directly, its the basis of many other more complex algorithm(that’s why we call it naive), and Naive Bayes with its developed version has been widely applyed in a wide range of statistical learning tasks like <a href="">text classification</a>.</p>
